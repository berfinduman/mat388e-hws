| A)    (20) General Structure of the homework                                             |    |                                                                                                                                         |
| 1)    (5) Are codes reproducible?                                                        | 3  | While loop in Q1 gets stuck and does not produce output. In Q2 we get X_train name 'X_train' is not defined                             |
| 2)    (5) Can someone understand what is happening in the returned homework?             | 4  | Yes. However, there are lots of EDA without verbal exlanation. If you prefer to include an analysis, you have to make a comment on it.  |
|  Is there any story telling? Does student follow the structure of homework or not?       |    |                                                                                                                                         |
| 3)    (5) Are codes readable? Are any comments available?                                | 5  | There are lots of empy code cells. Some comments are too long.                                                                          |
| Or just codes are pasted and student expects the reader to understand everything         |    |                                                                                                                                         |
| 4)    (5) Is it a well-prepared homework in general or is it a homework done to be done? | 3  | This is scientific documentation and report. Keep a formal language, do not include personal explanations.                              |
|                                                                                          |    | Scientific, model building related comments are included in the code cells.                                                             |
|                                                                                          |    | Include them in text paragraphs. Round numbers in paragraphs to 4 digits etc.                                                           |
